### What this is

This is a simple tokenizer that takes a C function and turns each character into a token. I hadn't done much code parsing, and I wanted to get some idea of what the program would look like.

### What it does

1. Parses the C code
2. Identifies its type
3. Prints each token to stdout along with its type.

Again, it's nothing special, just a little demo of what a parser might look like.

### How to build

`./build.sh && ./tokenizer`
